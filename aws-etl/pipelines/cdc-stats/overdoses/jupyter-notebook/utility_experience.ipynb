    "# Automated Lateral Digitization and Meter Association\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook outlines a method for generating approximately 300,000 service lateral lines from existing lateral line features and associating them with nearby water meters. The purpose of this workflow is to automate the digitization of lateral features to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enable the generation of unique identifiers that can be used to track work orders related to individual meters.\n",
    "- Associate laterals with meter locations to determine unknown lateral attributes.\n",
    "- Provide necessary infrastructure data to support EPA Lead and Copper Rule compliance, including material inventory and risk identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Process\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Subset data using a grid index to optimize performance.\n",
    "2. For each lateral line feature:\n",
    "     - Generate evenly spaced vertices along the line.\n",
    "     - Convert those vertices to points.\n",
    "3. For each point:\n",
    "     - Use a proximity analysis to find the nearest water meter.\n",
    "     - Retrieve meter attributes such as Meter ID.\n",
    "4. For each vertex-meter pair:\n",
    "     - Extract XY coordinates.\n",
    "     - Generate a line feature connecting them.\n",
    "5. Compile all outputs into a new feature class of digitized laterals with associated metadata."
